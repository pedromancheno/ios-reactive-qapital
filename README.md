### Reactive Qapital Demo App
A simple demo app that shows some of the patterns used at Qapital for Reactive Programming.

To get started run
```sh
carthage bootstrap --platform ios
```
The repo also includes a small Sinatra http server so start that with
```sh
ruby ReactiveServer.ru
```
You should now be able to run the sample app against the local server.
